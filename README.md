# Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project tried to answer, if and to which degree, the progamming language Julia is used. In order to answer this, three questions were answered:

1) How many of the interviewees had worked with Julia compared to Python?
2) How many people are planning to work with Julia?
3) And are people in data related jobs more likely to use Julia?

# Results <a name="results"></a>

You can find the answers of the those questions [here](https://thomas-pietras.medium.com/is-julia-the-snake-charmer-4cf1ae89128)
